One of the best [metamagic] feats available to casters, this is a very good investment for the druid class, because they have so many good buffs. You will probably be using metamagic rods of extend, lesser for most of your low-level buffs, but you can also use this until the more expensive metamagic rods become available for the spells that are higher than level 3. Extend spell also sets you up for persistent spell; the druid class doesn't have access to many metamagic cost reducers or divine metamagic that other classes have, so persistent spell is only a viable choice for the druid as your level 15 or 18 level feat.
