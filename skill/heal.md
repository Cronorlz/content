Heal is not as important as concentration and handle animal are, but, thankfully, it requires minimal investment in order to make the most out of it, mostly because it's wisdom based. If you would like to also use the healing lorecall spell from spell compendium, then you just need to spend 10 ranks to it, which are a lot â€“ usually around 5 will do fine. First aid, long-term care and treating wounds from caltrops, spike growth or spike stones all require a DC15 check, which is pretty easy to do even for 1st level characters. The most useful of these options is usually first aid, because it can save dying characters, but is usually not the best thing you can do in battle; besides, a cure minor wounds would also do the trick. Outside of battle, treat poison and treat disease can stay relevant for the first few levels, where your heal check will be a lot better than your fortitude saving throw. These functions are usable as standard actions. In complete adventurer this skill receives another use: you can use heal to determine how a dead creature was killed and the most difficult check is if the creature was killed by a spell with no visible spell effects, so with the same investment you can make use of this, too.
