Concentration is a bit like saving throws: you want to have a good check, but it's better if you are not in a position to make one in the first place; the reason for this is that some of the difficulty classes that you need to beat are abnormally high – for instance the DC of being damaged during the casting of a spell is equal to 10+damage dealt+spell level. Imagine that you are casting a summon nature's ally I spell and someone deals 4 damage to you – that calls for a concentration DC15 check (10+4 damage+1 spell level), which is a gamble for a low level character, almost a 50% chance.

Do note that a summoner will have to make this kind of concentration checks a lot of times, because summon nature's ally has a casting time of 1 round (which, as explained earlier is different from a full-round action), so it's possible to get hit multiple times until your next turn. There other spells with casting times of 1 round, like antilife shell, call lightning, changestaff, creeping doom, dominate animal, fire storm, insect plague and summon swarm – in core the druid class has quite possibly the highest amount of spells with this casting time.

On page 70 of the player's handbook there is a table which lists all the distractions that call for concentration checks. Do note that these numbers are actually higher for spellcasters, because you get to add the spell's level to the difficulty class of the check, but, with the exception of taking damage during the action that was already covered above and is difficult to recover from, regardless of level, the rest of them are only a challenge at low levels. For example, if you are a 10th level druid with maxed out concentration, you will be easily hitting checks of 15, so you need to roll a 5 or higher in order to cast your maximum level spell (5th) on your galloping animal companion (DC20).

If you cast a spell you provoke attacks of opportunity; if the attack of opportunity deals damage to you, you risk of losing the spell, as per the damage taken distraction. This is a real threat for many druids that assume melee forms and want to cast a buff that has a casting time of a standard action. The concentration skill enables you to cast your spells defensively, which means that you get to cast it as normal if you succeed on a concentration check with a difficulty class of 15+spell level, but you don't provoke attacks of opportunity. Use this ability with caution, because if you fail the check, you lose the spell you are trying to cast automatically; if you subtract the damage taken distraction from this one, then the difference is 5 – this means that it's almost as if you have taken 5 points of damage from the opportunity attack, so if you are dealing with an enemy that will potentially deal less than that, it's best to just provoke the attack of opportunity (this should be quite rare), but if your opponent is able to deal more than 5 points of damage, then it's better to just cast defensively and avoid the interruption.
