Mentioned because after a certain level, low level echoing summon nature's ally spells can be used as utility, so you don't care whether they stay around for a long time or they can be dispelled easily. There are a lot of low level buffs that you can use with echoing spell, even in battle, mostly because they are not affected by caster level. An example would be snake's swiftness, which gives extra attacks to allied creatures â€“ an echoing snake's swiftness, mass is a 5th level spell and the last casting is going to behave exactly as the first casting. An echoing spell uses a slot that is three slots higher than the spell that you are enhancing with it.
