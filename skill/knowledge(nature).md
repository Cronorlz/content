Your only knowledge skill, it is a very good idea to max it out, because it is very effective as a monster identification skill â€“ it will give you information about the animal, fey, giant, monstrous humanoid, plant and vermin types, the highest amount of all the knowledges. The difficulty class for identifying a monster is generally 10+the monster's hit dice. A successful check will allow you to remember one useful piece of information about the monster, plus one for every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, so if you score an 25 against a monster with 5HD, then you can recall three useful pieces of information about it. Knowledge(nature) will also grant you a +2 synergy bonus on survival checks made in aboveground natural environments.
