  Very useful if you are in melee battle often, this [reserve] feat offers you various uses for your swift action, the best one of which are the vigor and the might options. Vigor gives you temporary hit points equal to your hit dice, which will boost your effective hit points ridiculously, especially if you keep renewing them each round; on the other hand might is useful on forms that have a high number of attacks. This feat can be picked up at your 9th level at the earliest, because it requires that you are able to cast 3rd level spells. The other options are useful, but usually not in battle. You might use speed a couple of times if that 5ft makes a difference or savagery if the form that you have transformed into doesn't have claw attacks, but it won't be that often as the other options.
