When you cast a conjuration spell, which includes all your summons, then you can create a small cloud that makes living creatures inside it sickened. This feat has its drawbacks, for instance it affects only living creatures that are not immune to poison, however it makes people sickened without a save and this condition imposed a -2 penalty on nearly every roll â€“ including saves. Since summon spells are going to take 1 round to cast and you will finish casting them just before the beginning of your next round, then you can engulf an enemy in the cloud and then you can use a debuff against him.
