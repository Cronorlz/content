This [tactical] feat is mentioned especially for the lingering metamagic option. Basically, if you cast a spell that is enhanced by metamagic feats and then cast the same spell in the following round, you can apply one of the metamagic feats from the first casting to the second one for free. This is going to apply mainly to summon nature's ally spells enhanced by the rapid spell metamagic feat, but you can also cast persistent or extended buffs on you and then cast the same spell again for your companion.
