One of the two detecting skills, listen is used to hear the enemies that are trying to sneak up on you. Listen is the check you will have to make against an enemy that uses the move silently skill in order to go around unnoticed. Like the heal skill, this is a wisdom based skill, so your check will be quite good even if you don't invest a lot of skill points. If you want to make the most out of the listening lorecall spell from spell compendium, a low level spell that provides you with blindsight if you have 12 ranks in the listen skill, then make sure to pump it until you're in the mid levels. Otherwise, 5 ranks will do just fine â€“ they are even enough to qualify for the listen to this skill trick from complete scoundrel.
