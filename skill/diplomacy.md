This is one of those skills that in the optimization world is treated as overpowered and game-breaking, but druids don't have the necessary backup from spells and abilities to make their check really high. However this is still one of the most useful skills, even though that you won't be able to skip encounters by making hostile people friendly or helpful. The skill that is described in the player's handbook enables you to change the attitude of an NPC. If you are able to safely hit a score of 20, then you can make hostile NPCs unfriendly and unfriendly NPCs indifferent (or even friendly with a score of 25, which is very close). By the way, this is the same way that wild empathy works, even though you won't be using the diplomacy skill for that. In complete adventurer diplomacy also has the haggle option – if you manage to get a vendor's attitude to helpful (most vendors start as indifferent), then you get a 10% discount on the price. This option is very good if it is allowed by your dungeon master, but it's difficult to make the check – getting an NPC from unfriendly to helpful is a DC30 check and it is made worse because you add the vendor's diplomacy modifier to the DC. Also in complete adventurer, there's the mediate option, which is a check for influencing a whole group of adventurers.
