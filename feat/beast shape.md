With this feat you gain the ability to use wild shape in order to transform into the beast that you have chosen with the beast totem feat. You also gain the extraordinary and supernatural abilities of the creature, which is a good opportunity to snag some different ability. Unfortunately, the forms that you can select are very underwhelming, compared to your normal options. Additionally, you are limited only to one choice and you have to give up two feat slots for that single creature. Unicorns have a magic circle against evil effect that surrounds them and can be useful versus other summoners, or for keeping your summons and animal companion immune to dominate effects and other enchantments. Chimerae do a good amount of damage in melee, but you can find something similar at that level in plain animal and if it's a feline it will probably possess the pounce ability, too. The rest, maybe with the exception of the gorgon, which has a petrification attack aren't worth it.
