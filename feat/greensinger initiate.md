Greensinger is unfortunately not that good as gatekeeper initiate is, but it can be used if you need bluff, hide or perform as class skills for some reason. The spells that greensinger provides are mostly enchantments and they can be useful, but they don't compare to the spells that gatekeepers get. Note that if the planar shepard is allowed, then this feat automatically gets a lot better, because it is the main way of qualifying for the prestige class.
