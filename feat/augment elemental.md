This is exactly the same benefit with Augment Summoning and you can use it in a few ways. First of all, since the bonuses are arguably the same, you can substitute Augment Summoning with this feat and save a feat slot; however do note that constitution and strength bonuses can also boost the difficulty class of some of the special abilities that the elementals get. On the other hand you can also get both â€“ after a certain level elementals are a much better option than animals, so it's going to apply often to your summoned creatures. Thankfully, augment elemental only lists 2 ranks of knowledge(the planes) as a requirement, which you can easily get by spending cross-class skills or through the 4th level planar substitution level or the gatekeeper initiate feat. If it listed spell focus(conjuration) and augment summoning as requirements then this feat would have a lot less utility.
