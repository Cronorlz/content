In races of the dragon, there are specific guidelines for mining, which is supposed to be a specialty of the kobold race. With a check result of 15 you can remove a 5 foot cube of rock, while with each additional 5 points you can remove an additional cube; each check represents 8 hours of work. This might not seem to be much and you can probably do better if you use certain spells, but if you have the downtime you can dig really deep. It's not recommended to get higher than a couple of skill points, though.
