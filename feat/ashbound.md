Ashbound gives the creatures you summon through the summon nature's ally spell double duration (so you can potentially quadruple the duration if you cast an extended summon nature's ally) and a +3 luck bonus to the summoned creatures' attack rolls. The benefits are solid, however they are more suited to characters that are at the lower levels, where duration is still an issue. The attack roll bonus will benefit everyone, but it's also true that as you gain levels the creatures you summon will possess abilities that do not require attack rolls; some elementals are able to cast blasting spells and large animals can trample.
