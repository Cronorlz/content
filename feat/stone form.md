You can use this feat to transform yourself into a stone and I assure you that this feat is so dull as this description sounds. You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws versus poison and your natural armor is set to 4. You also gain a slam attack that deals damage according to your size. The last saving grace of the feat would be to explicitly mention that your form doesn't change, that this is a minor wild shape form and that you don't need natural spell in order to cast spells, however, this is implied (the slam attack's damage scales according to your size), but it's not mentioned (the special says that without this feat a druid can assume a wild shape form of an animal, plant or elemental, which classifies stone form as a 'form').
