Generally vermin forms are not so versatile as animal and plant forms, so choosing to wild shape into one is not something that you normally want to do. If for some reason you want to have the ability to wild shape into one, then there is an item from dungeon master's guide II, which is called vestment of verminshape â€“ it provides you with the ability to assume the shape of vermins with wild shape without other limitations, it doesn't require a feat and it is an affordable item, as it costs 20.000.
