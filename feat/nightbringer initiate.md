Add the sneaky skills (hide and move silently) to your class skills list. I'm against hide and move silently, especially if you can pick skills from spell compendium â€“ in there you can find low level spells with long durations that provide +20 to hide and +10 to move silently, which is enough for you to be sneaky, especially if you use wild shape to assume a form that is small. The nicest spell in the nightbringer list is enervation; for this spell alone a feat slot is a fair trade.
