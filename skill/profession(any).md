You can earn some money by practicing your trade, which in game terms is equal to half your profession check in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. I'm mentioning this because profession is a skill that is wisdom based, so you will get a large bonus by your main ability score modifier without investing more than one rank in this. Even though you will make more by adventuring, it doesn't hurt to know how much you are able to make through your skills – if there is a large downtime in your campaign, you will rarely have something better to do, unless it's crafting. Assuming 1 rank and somewhere around 4 to 5 of wisdom modifier, then your check is going to be somewhere around 6 to 26 – an average of 16, which gives you 8 gold pieces per week. 32 per month, or 384 per year.
