If you want to play a summoner and your starting level is less than 10, then this feat is borderline broken. The greenbound template turns your animal summons into plants, which provide them with all the appropriate bonuses, but it also enhances their natural armor, gives them a slam attack, damage reduction, fast healing, grapple bonus and big attribute bonuses (+6 str, +2 dex, +4 con). Additionally, a greenbound creature is able to cast some spell-like abilities like entangle and wall of thorns – a greenbound creature can only cast a wall of thorns and still contribute greatly in a battle. Unfortunately, greenbound summoning only gives the benefit of the template to your animal summons; after around level 10 elementals start getting better. If feat retraining is allowed in your game, you can swap greenbound summoning for rashemi elemental summoning; you have to remember though that rashemi elemental summoning has a caster level requirement of 5, so you will pick it up at level 9 – which is fine for your elementals, it's that you will be getting greenbound summoning a little late.
