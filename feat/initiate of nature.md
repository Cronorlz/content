Do you like having an animal companion? How about getting another one by selecting this feat as your 9th level feat? This feat gives you the option to command or rebuke animal or plant creatures like an evil cleric commands or rebukes undead. This means that you can command an additional 1 hit die per character level that you possess, which is a good amount and depending on your level it's like getting a second animal companion. Unfortunately this also opens a can of worms – commanding animals and plants requires that you have a respectable charisma score and eagle's splendor is not on the druid spell list; there are other buffs that you can employ though to beef up your charisma, but you can't really dump it. Also note that you need to score turning damage equal to twice the creature's hit die in order to command it – that means that if you want to command a tendriculos, you need to score 18 on a roll that's 2d6+character level+charisma modifier. Thankfully, animal hit dice are superior to undead hit dice – certain undead have a lot of hit dice for some reason (maybe the fact that they don't have a constitution score has something to do here, or maybe the designers where thinking proactively about having low hit die creatures that a base class could command), but they aren't especially good. On the other hand, you can get animals or plants that are very useful. The feat also gives a couple of initiate of nature-only feats, but they're nothing special.
