Usually this feat won't be required, as most charger forms already possess the pounce extraordinary special attack. If you want to transform in a form that would be good at charging, but lacks pounce, then you can pick up this feat in your 9th level slot. Do note that the [wild] feat lion's pounce is strictly worse than this feat, unless you somehow lose the turn after you wild shape.
