Skills represent a variety of abilities that the character is proficient with. As a character advances in level, so do these abilities, making the character better, however only a subset of the skills that are open to a class can be increased per level; this is represented by skill points - the amount of ranks that you gain per level to spend on your skills. Thankfully, the druid class has an average amount of skill ranks per level; if you also count that most of the times the human race is the best available race for a druid and that druid builds tend to focus on mental stats, as strength and dexterity are dump abilities, then it's possible for a druid to have 5-8 skill points per level to work with. 

Unfortunately, even though skills provide you with some useful abilities that can be used both in and out of battle, my feelings are mixed about them; they often tend to be underwhelming TODO 

There are some special rules that can be used with skill checks and if you are reading this guide, it's possible that you already know about them, but those are taking 10, taking 20, aid another and skill synergy. 

Taking 10 means that you can treat the 1d20 die result as if you have rolled a 10, but only when you aren't being threatened or distracted. 

Taking 20 is similar to taking 10, in the sense that you mustn't be threatened or distracted in order to use it, but you treat the result of the 1d20 die as a 20. This isn't the same as taking 10, because it assumes that if you try multiple times, you will eventually get a result of 20, but you will also fail 19 times and it will also take you 20 times more time to complete. 

Aid another is a method of helping the skill checks of others by attempting the same check; if you roll 10 or higher, then you provide the character you are helping a +2 bonus on his check. Since a druid has the potential to summon creatures and it also has an animal companion, you can regularly use aid another - for instance satyrs are intelligent, have some good skill checks and you can summon them using summon nature's ally III, which is low enough after a certain level to spam; the good thing about aid another is that the bonus is untyped, so you can benefit from multiple people helping you, although in the description it does say that the dungeon master can impose a limit. There's a variant rule in complete adventurer and it has been made more standard in the rules compendium - that's expert assistance, i.e. for every 10 points your aid another check result exceeds 10, you give another +1 bonus to the character that you help, but unless you are really lucky with your result, if you can safely hit 20+ rolls on a certain skill check, maybe it would be better if others assisted you and not the other way around (unless they can safely hit checks higher than yours of course), which makes this ability kind of moot. 

In complete adventurer there is rule similar to aid another, but you can use it to provide a bonus to a group of allies. It works if you have 5 ranks in a skill and you can provide a +2 circumstance to allies within 30ft who can see and hear you, but you get a -4 penalty to the check; it's important that all allies that get the bonus and you must be engaged in the same task. Some tasks don't reserve your standard action, e.g. hide is made as part of a move action, so you can stack this method of assisting your allies with an aid another check on a specific ally. If you have 15 ranks in a skill you can accept a -10 penalty to provide a +5 circumstance bonus on the same skill checks. Generally, this only is usable with balance, bluff, climb, craft, diplomacy, escape artist, handle animal, hide, move silently, ride, search, survival and swim, but the dungeon master may rule that other skills may benefit from this under special circumstances. 

Skill synergy isn't something that you actively use; if you have 5 or more ranks in certain skills, then you get an untyped passive +2 bonus to other skill(s). Certain skills provide very general bonuses, like survival boosting your knowledge(nature) checks, but there are other skills that give synergy bonuses which have a narrower scope, like search, which boosts survival checks only when used to follow tracks. 

I'd also like to note an important detail that most people tend to overlook: a natural 20 is not an automatic success and a natural 1 is not an automatic failure when you are rolling for skill checks. I felt the need to mention this because I had a lot of dungeon masters that gave out more information to characters that rolled a natural 20 on a knowledge check, even though my character had a better score, but without rolling a natural success. 

After mastering his wild shape ability, it's natural that a druid will have very good ability scores. In this case, it's good to know about a variant rule that's in the dungeon master's guide and may be potentially beneficial; it is called skills with different abilities and it is located in page 33 and it gives examples of skill uses that call for different ability modifiers than that that was originally assigned to them. 

I tend to make a division when selecting skills, according to the usefulness of the abilities they represent. There are those that are useless and you should never invest points in them unless you want to do something special or fulfill a certain requirement; an example would be swim if you already possess a swim speed. Certain skills need only a minor investment, as you can easily take 10 with them and only a couple of skill points are needed to unlock their functions; skills that give good synergy bonuses fall into this category. There are skills that is good to have high, but after a certain level you get diminishing returns; e.g. getting the listen skill to 12 ranks for listening lorecall is good, but considering that the druid is a wisdom based caster, any ranks after that isn't going to get you much better. Finally, there are those skills that are very useful and you can never have enough; for instance maintaining your spell with concentration after being attacked depends on the damage that you take, so it's a good idea to always keep it maxed - in the same spirit, knowledge(nature) and the other monster identification knowledges require a 10+the hit dice of the monster to give you a useful piece of information; for each 5 points that you beat the DC, you can recall another piece of useful information, so it's a good idea to keep your knowledge maxed.
