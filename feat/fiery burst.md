If feat retraining is allowed by your dungeon master, then you can use these [reserve] feats at low levels and then swap them out for something better. At low levels resources is an actual issue – you don't have enough spells to go through the day, so you need a solid method of attacking that doesn't run out and is superior to attacking with weapons. Assuming that you will get these feats at 3rd level at the earliest, due to the requirement of being able to cast 2nd level spells, they will serve you good for a couple of levels, but after you get wild shape they will quickly lose their effectiveness. Fiery burst doesn't require a ranged attack roll – it gives your enemies the chance to make a saving throw in order to halve the damage. This makes it a very good tool for druids that want to start with low ability scores, with the hope that their scores will be enhanced by wild shape later, because the druid doesn't have to make any roll, like the ranged attack roll that acidic splatter requires. On the other hand acidic splatter deals acid damage, which might be better compared to fire. There are other feats that deal elemental damage, but I feel that these two are the superior options.
