The druid is a thematically wonderful class from the 3.5e Player's Handbook. As with most of the spellcaster classes from that book, the Druid is considered to be one of the most powerful classes in the game and has the potential to excel in almost every aspect or party role - he is able to have raw damage output, be the party face and has enormous utility through his spells and forms outside of combat.

In the 3.5e of D&D, playing one of the spellcasting classes from the Player's Handbook can be a daunting task, as the seer number of the available options can discourage players from planning a character build that they are satisfied with. The target of this guide is to assist players with practical optimization; that is, help them build a druid that is going to be actually played as a member of a party. This means that you won't find theoretical optimization or 'broken' builds in here, or builds that rely heavily on RAW vs RAI arguments to work.

If you try to analyze the base classes in the Player's Handbook, you will see that a fair amount of them share a common design or rather they have been approached by the designers in the same way. This design pattern that the base classes share is what I call the axis approach; the axis approach works like this: work on a few class features that their characteristic is that they span across all or most of the 20 levels of a class; as you acquire more levels, these features become stronger, give you more options or both at the same time. Based on that fact, you can clearly see that the paladin's axises are 'mount', 'lay on hands', 'smite' or that the rogue class has 'sneak attack', 'trap sense' and 'special abilities' or that the barbarian is all about 'rage', 'damage reduction' and 'trap sense'. An important note is that these 'axes' rarely intersect by themselves, without the outside influence of a feat or a class feature of a prestige class.

If we try to analyze the druid class using the axis approach, we will identify three main categories: the Beast (wild shape), the Summoner (spellcasting) and the Master (animal companion). These are three aspects that coexist in any druid build at the same time and they are telling how a druid build is going to accomplish all those things that he is capable of, as it's through these aspects that he is going to unlock his potential. It's important to have this information breakdown as a player, in order to know what to expect when you are playing the class; the druid is capable of destroying opponents through the power of nature or through transforming themselves in terrifying creatures, but don't play this class if you want to swing huge swords, because it will let you down.

This guide is dedicated to druid builds that do not focus solely on one of the three aspects, but they progress all three aspects at the same time.

Another warning about being let down by the druid class - avoid playing a druid build if you don't like bookeeping; this is because the amount of upkeep the druid class requires is probably among the highest - you need to keep track of your sheet, your companion, your stat changes with every wild shape form, the improved stats of summoned creatures because of your class abilities (e.g. Augment Summoning) and you shouldn't forget that druids are actually full casters that need to memorize spells - vancian spellcasting alone is complicated enough for many players; and this is something that you need to revise every time that you gain a level. If you decide to play a druid, please make sure that you can keep up with multiple sheets for a single character and that you have the modified stats of the creatures that you most like to summon readily available; if you try to generate the stats on-the-fly you will be losing a lot of time going through manuals and you will end up irritating your DM and your friends if you keep doing it all the time. Of course, sooner or later you will have to do this, because you can't be prepared for every situation, but make sure that you have generated the stats of your favorite wild shape forms and your favorite summons to minimize the chances.

If you get past all that preparation that the class needs, it's very rewarding to play it, especially if you like versatile characters. The beauty of the druid is its ability to adapt to the needs of the current situation, mainly because of the tools in his arsenal - summon nature's ally and wild shape can be used in completely different ways without any downtime or preparation.

An important piece of information is that multiclassing as a druid is rarely beneficial, at least if you want all of your aspects to be progressed equally. This is true because there are no prestige classes (or at least, they are very rare) out there that progress your companion, your spellcasting and your wild shape abilities at the same time, except from additional druid levels of course. This is something that all classes that use the axis design pattern heavily share, e.g. you can't multiclass as a paladin and keep your spellcasting, your special mount and your lay on hands at an equal level; if you want to specialize in a specific aspect, you need to pay the price of specialization by sacrificing the power of the rest of your aspects. The bottom line is that if you are unsure about how to plan your build, at least when you select your classes, the safest (and many times, the most optimal) option is to just go with 20 levels in the druid class; I know that this is a very unintuitive piece of advice, especially in the multiclassing madness that D&D 3.5e is, but in my experience, elegant and simple druid builds that do not reserve assets for prestige class requirements are the superior ones.
