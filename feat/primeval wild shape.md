This feat enhances your wild shape form with additional abilities, but makes it last a round per level instead of an hour per level. The main point of the wild shape ability is that you are able to keep it on for lots of hours â€“ if you sacrifice that long-lasting duration, then it must be for something better than 2 points of strength, 2 points of natural armor and 10 points of cold resistance.
