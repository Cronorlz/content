Natural bond falls under the same category as practiced spellcaster – it is used to make your animal companion class feature up to date with the rest of your build, if you dipped into classes that don't progress it. Like practiced spellcaster, natural bond is a feat that you pick out of necessity and is a filler feat – other important feats have higher priority over this. It's not clear what happens if you have chosen an animal companion with a penalty to your effective druid level in order to acquire it (when you are single classed of course), however, a couple of skills points and a potential feat isn't worth it most of the times. If it really makes a difference in your build, then ask your dungeon master how they would interact. Natural bond doesn't progress alternative class abilities that you swap your animal companion for, like a shifter's beast spirit, because the feat requires the animal companion class feature. Finally remember that the animal companion abilities max out at level 18, so you have some space before needing this feat.
