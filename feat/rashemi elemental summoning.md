The other powerful summoning feat from the faerun campaign setting, with this feat you can transform earth elementals into thomils and air elementals into orglashes. If you are starting at level 10+ then it's a good idea to skip greenbound summoning and start planning to get this feat at your 9th level slot. Orglashes can use a cone of cold as a special attack three times per day, which at the beginning isn't much – a medium air elemental that you are able to summon with summon nature's ally IV will only do a cone of cold that does 4d6 damage, but large air elementals have 8 hit dice and once you begin summon lots of them – two or three creatures, it quickly ramps up. On the other hand thomils have a special form of grapple called engulf – it's like a combination of grapple, trample and swallow whole – it moves over opponents and then attempts to enclose them in its body; it also is able to affect multiple opponents, provided that it can cover all of them at the same time.
