If you want to cast summon nature's ally as a standard action, this is the best alternative if you don't want to limit your race choices and keep your animal companion; this is because the other way would be by getting the first shifter substitution level, which trades your animal companion and gives you the rapid summons ability at level 12. The downside to this is that you have to memorize your summon nature's ally spells, enhanced by this metamagic feat.
