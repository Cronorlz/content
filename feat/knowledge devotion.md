  This feat is mentioned because it fits perfectly in your 3rd level slot and is the only one of the [domain] feats that provides a passive bonus; as such you don't need to power it with turn undead attempts – it is always providing you bonuses. Knowledge devotion is a good idea if you're planning to follow the beast archetype, as it's one of the few ways, spells not included, that a class feature provides bonuses to wild shape forms; the bonuses are even insight, which will rarely conflict with the bonuses that the spells provide. Among the monster identifying knowledges, knowledge(nature) identifies the highest amount of creature types, which is why this is worth it. You will most probably grab knowledge(the planes) through the 4th planar druid substitution level, because replacing resist nature's lure is very welcome; if you count that you can grab another knowledge as a class skill through the feat's benefit (most probably arcane or religion), then you will be able to apply the feat's bonus to almost all creature types: animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, vermin, outsiders, elementals, constructs, dragons and magical beasts. It's a good idea to spend just one cross-class skill on religion, local and dungeoneering if you don't have them as class skills in order to be able to make the check – even if the check result is less than 15, you still get a +1 bonus on attack and damage.
