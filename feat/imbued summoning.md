Use this [metamagic] feat if you want to give buffs to the creatures that you summon without spending time for buffing them. Usually, you'll want to cast things like align fang, babau slime and nature's favor depending on the situation and the summoned creature. Do note that you can't use bull's strength and bear's2 endurance, because they are not going to do anything – you see, imbued summoning requires augment summoning and that already provides your summoned creatures with a +4 enchantment bonus to strength and constitution. Finally, if you like using this feat, you can substitute it with an item called summoner's totem from the magic item compendium. It's very cheap, but it's a little bit more restrictive than imbued summoning – you must take a swift action to cast the second spell, it's casting time must be no higher than 1 standard action and it must target the summoned creature (and only the summoned creature); this last restriction is a bit weird and it's not a problem if you can target parts of the creature specifically, too (many spells target a creature's natural weapons for instance) – it's just there to make sure that you won't quicken spells that targets others for free. This is the interpretation that I think is the correct one, but it's best that you resolve this with your DM.
