Druids have a load of long lasting buffs and a lot of times they last for hours per level. The idea behind this feat would be to use it during your buffing routine, when you don't really care how much time it takes to cast a buff; a +3 from this feat, along with a +4 from a bead of karma and a +1 from an orange ioun stone could give you a +8 bonus to your caster level, which is going to make your buffs last long and harder to dispel. This feat requires you to boost your spellcraft to 9 ranks and, indirectly, your concentration to max ranks in order to make the concentration checks that it requires; this is something that you should be doing, anyway.
