Initiate of Malar is one of the ways you can skip the requirement of augment summoning – this feat gives you an animal-only bonus of the augment summoning feat for free, as the given power of the initiate feat. The problem is that Malar is an evil deity and that is going to limit your spell selection a bit – you can't access [good] or [exalted] spells. Moreover, you can only use this feat at low to mid levels, where the animal summons are still relevant. Aside from these, initiate of Malar is a good fit for your 3rd level slot.
