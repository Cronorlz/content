Companion spellbond extends the range of the share spells ability to 30ft, instead of the standard 5ft. The standard share spells ability is useful for buffing your companion or sharing spells that have an instantaneous duration, but sharing buffs that last longer often isn't practical, because if your companion moves more than 5ft away from you then the effects of the shared spells are gone. Having said that, if you want to have your animal companion attack a target, then it will almost surely move away from you; this is where companion spellbond comes in â€“ if you want to use a companion for something more than a mount and still have it benefit from shared spells, then this is a feat that you could use.
